CHANGELOG
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for release 0.8.2 all by tbradley@jabber.com

	* Added some comments to make the code easier to read

	* Reformatted some code, again just for readability


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes up to release 0.8.1 from here down, all by Kerem HADIMLI 
<waster@iname.com>


	Waster - 19:29 GMT+0200 - 30 Apr 2000
	  * Moved back to the old version of XML-parser. Now, it will work with
	    Tcl8.0 and later.
	  * Now, it doesn't search for childtags under <body/> tag. The
	    "extbody" parameter is changed to a list, containg error_code and
	    error_text of the message.
	  * Modified wrapper.tcl to be able to use multiple XML streams at the
	    same time. See wrapper:new (to create a new wrapper) and
	    wrapper:parser (to access the XML-library's parser command) in
	    wrapper.tcl.

	Waster - 00:22 GMT+0200 - 31 Mar 2000
	  * Lots of bugs fixes, etc, but I didn't add them to ChangeLog in the
	    last month. Now it's fully compatible with 0.9 protocol, with all
	    bugs fixed.
	  * The main difference is, now it is using a newer version of the XML
	    parsing library, which needs Tcl8.1 or a later version to run.

	Waster - 19:16 GMT+0200 - 29 Feb 2000
	  * It wasn't parsing the contents of the error tag in an error reply
	    to a query correctly. Fixed.

	Waster - 14:31 GMT+0200 - 26 Feb 2000
	  * Now, incoming iq results don't need to have <query/> in them.

	Waster - 01:37 GMT+0200 - 21 Jan 2000
	  * It was checking jabber:iq:auth instead of jabber:iq:roster to
	    understand roster-pushes from server. Fixed.

	Waster - 15:50 GMT+0200 - 14 Jan 2000
	  * Added jlib::clear_iqs procedure. It calls remaining iq-callbacks
	    with "DISCONNECT" parameter when disconnected.

	Waster - 03:44 GMT+0200 - 12 Jan 2000
	  * Fixed lots of bugs in jlib::roster_get procedure. Now, roster_get
	    works correctly.

	Waster - 22:43 GMT+0200 - 10 Jan 2000
	  * Tested with zABBER. Seems to work without problems.
	  * Bugfixes.

	Waster - 21:27 GMT+0200 - 08 Jan 2000
	  * Small bugfixes.

	Waster - 01:37 GMT+0200 - 02 Jan 2000
	  * Made necessary changes for 0.8.1 protocol.

	Waster - 00:24 GMT+0200 - 27 Dec 1999
	  * First 0.8 release. Everything is rewritten since 0.7 one, and
	    should work without any problems, but not tested yet.

CHANGELOG
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in release 0.8.2 (all from tbradley@jabber.com):

	21 Sep 2000
	
	I think the original release numbering was meant to correspond to
	the server versions.  Since server version 1.1 is now out, clearly
	this numbering convention isn't valid anymore.  Also, the numbers
	of jabberlib and zabber seem to be in sync.  I've incremented both
	version numbers to 0.8.2, just so they remain in sync.

	Changes to zABBER:

	* removed priority spin button on message send window

	* changed debug window to make it easier to read output 
	  (added x scroller)

	* changed window creation order so all windows appear on Windows

	* renamed the "source" subdirectory to "contrib"--this contains 
	  source libraries from other people

	* removed extraneous files from "contrib"--there were some code
	  libraries there that zABBER isn't using

	* upgraded iniparse to 1.3.2 (from Waster, djsmoke, and infernix)

	* upgraded combobox to 2.0b2 (from Bryan Oakley)

	* added tons of comments in the source (especially zABBER) to 
	  make it easier to read and understand the code
